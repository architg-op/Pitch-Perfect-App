# Pitch-Perfect
### iOS Developer Nano Degree Project

The Pitch Perfect app is result of Intro to iOS App Development with Swift lesson of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree course.

The App allows users to Record a sound using the Deviceâ€™s Microphone. It then Allows Users to Play the Recorded Sound back with six different Sound Modulations: _Chipmunk_, _Darth Vader_, _Slow_, Fast with _Reverb_ and _Echo_ effect.

## Implementation

Pitch Perfect has two Scenes: 

- **RecordSoundsViewController** : consists a record button with a microphone image. Tapping this microphone button starts an audio recording session and present a stop button. When the stop button is clicked, the app completes recording and then show the PlaySound controller.
- **PlaySoundsViewController** : contains six buttons to play the recorded sound file with different effects related to the button image and a stop button at the bottom

*The App supports both orientations. I have varied traits for the landscape orientation of PlaySoundsViewController to make it look good with the use of stack views. App also gives a nice Pop Animation when ever we change the orientation.*

The application uses code from `AVFoundation` to record sounds from the microphone `(AVAudioRecorder)` and play recorded audio with effects `(AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine)`.

## Requirements

- Xcode 8 Above
- Swift 3.0
